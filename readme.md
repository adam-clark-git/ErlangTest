# Project Title (Update)

This was an attempt to make a sudoku solving program using Erlang, a functional programming language.


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download the sudoku.erl file.
2. Then, launch Erlang, and then navigate to the directory of the sudoku.erl file.
3. Run c(sudoku).
4. Sudoku puzzles should be in this format: [[0,6,5,7,0,4,9,3,1], [2,4,3,5,0,0,0,0,0],[0,9,1,3,8,6,0,0,0],[0,2,0,1,0,8,0,0,4], [1,0,0,9,0,0,7,0,2], [3,0,0,6,5,2,8,0,9],[0,8,0,0,0,0,4,0,0], [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0,6,0,5,8,3]]
5. run sudoku:solve( INSERT PUZZLE HERE ).

Instructions for using the software:

1. The code should return the original puzzle if it's unsolveable.
2. Otherwise, it will return a completed puzzle.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* It should require 0 external libraries, as it's just using Erlang.

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Learn you some Erlang for great good!](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/contents)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I don't intend to change anything about the project, but if I did...
* [ ] Make the program run more efficiently.
* [ ] Generate new sudoku puzzles.
* [ ] Integrate it with more intuitive UI.
